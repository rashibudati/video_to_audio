# video_to_audio
A simple python codes which convert the video file to audio file.

Requirements:
1. Python 3.7
2. Pytesseract
3. Pyttsx3 
4. CV2

Note: I have used Pyttsx3 for converting text to audio. GTTS can be used instead.

The name of the files are enough for you to understand the flow of execution. 



Hint:

2. frame_text.py
3. text_audio.py
